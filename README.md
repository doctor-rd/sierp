## A small DOS program which draws a Sierpinski triangle.

This program displays the well-known Sierpinski triangle. This is done by
computing Pascal's triangle modulo 2. See [Wikipedia]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle).

I know there are smaller versions out there but they look different. :)
